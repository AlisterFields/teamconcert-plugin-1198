<div>
  <p>
   The name of the build repository workspace within the Rational Team Concert (RTC) server.
   Only one workspace with the name should be defined. The build repository workspace should
   collaborate with the stream(s) to be built.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you have specific requirements related to how the build repository workspace should be
   loaded (example: create component folders, use load rules, delete the sandbox prior to
   loading, etc.) create a build definition that reflects the requirements. Use the option
   to build from a build definition instead of a workspace.
